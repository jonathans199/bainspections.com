                            <h2>Journey out of wreckage of Hurricane Andrew enters <strong class="strong-red"> 24th year of serving South Florida</strong></h2>
                            <p>It’s was 2:45AM on August 24, 1992, 
                                and John Micali was hunkered down 
                                straining to listen to updates on
                                 a battery-powered radio in his south 
                                 Miami condo. He could barely hear over
                                  the whistling sounds of electrical outlets, 
                                  roaring wind and thunder claps. Flashes of lightning pierced 
                                  through the darkness and the building shook. Outside, 140 mph 
                                  winds devastated the landscape. Micali recalls “When the wind stopped 
                                  and the sun came up, I opened the door, and everything was destroyed.
                                   I could see for miles. I knew life would never be the same.”</p>
                            <p>Nothing from his University of Florida education, 
                                nor his construction experience could have prepared
                                 Micali for the devastation he would soon encounter. 
                                 By December, he found himself inspecting and rebuilding
                                  damaged homes in Country Walk. The evolution that 
                                  transpired afterwards has taken Micali down a career
                                   path that has spanned over 2 decades. 
                                   “I found myself assessing buildings and writing 
                                   reports on the damages found as part of the bidding 
                                   and contracting process. The clients used my reports 
                                   to collect on insurance and determine the scope of the 
                                   repairs they needed. </p>
