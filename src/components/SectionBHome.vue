                        <p>It’s was 2:45AM on August 24, 1992, 
                            and John Micali was hunkered down 
                            straining to listen to updates on
                              a battery-powered radio in his south 
                              Miami condo. He could barely hear over
                              the whistling sounds of electrical outlets, 
                              roaring wind and thunder claps. Flashes of lightning pierced 
                              through the darkness and the building shook. Outside, 140 mph 
                              winds devastated the landscape. Micali recalls “When the wind stopped 
                              and the sun came up, I opened the door, and everything was destroyed.
                                I could see for miles. I knew life would never be the same.”</p>
                        <p>Nothing from his University of Florida education, 
                            nor his construction experience could have prepared
                              Micali for the devastation he would soon encounter. 
                              By December, he found himself inspecting and rebuilding
                              damaged homes in Country Walk. The evolution that 
                              transpired afterwards has taken Micali down a career
                                path that has spanned over 2 decades. 
                                “I found myself assessing buildings and writing 
                                reports on the damages found as part of the bidding 
                                and contracting process. The clients used my reports 
                                to collect on insurance and determine the scope of the 
                                repairs they needed. </p>
